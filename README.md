# chatbot

In this project is implemented, compared and analyzed two models, retrieval-based & generative, that constitute the state of the art in neural machine translation applied to chatbots. One model, i.e. retrieval-based model is based on simple neural network and for other generative model implementation is done exclusively using Sequence to Sequence(LSTM Encoder Decoder) architecture.
